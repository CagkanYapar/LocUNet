# LocUNet
LocUNet is a deep learning method to localize a UE based solely on the reported signal strengths from a set of BSs. The method utilizes accurate estimates of the radio maps of each BS, and is tailored to work in realistic propagation environments in urban settings. 

For more information see the paper [Real-time Outdoor Localization Using Radio Maps: A Deep Learning Approach](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.12556.pdf).

The associated dataset *RadioLocSeer* is available at the [project main page](https://radiomapseer.github.io/LocUNet.html).
