# LocUNet
LocUNet is a deep learning method to localize a UE based solely on the reported signal strengths from a set of BSs. The method utilizes accurate estimates of the radio maps of each BS, and is tailored to work in realistic propagation environments in urban settings. 

See the paper [Real-time Outdoor Localization Using Radio Maps: A Deep Learning Approach](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10122907/) for more information.

The associated *RadioLocSeer* dataset is available at the [IEEE Dataport](https://ieee-dataport.org/documents/dataset-pathloss-and-toa-radio-maps-localization-application) and on the [project main page](https://radiomapseer.github.io/LocUNet.html). Details of the dataset can be found in our dataset paper [Dataset of pathloss and ToA radio maps with localization application](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.11777).
