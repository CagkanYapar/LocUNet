# LocUNet
LocUNet is a deep learning method to localize a UE based solely on the reported signal strengths from a set of BSs. The method utilizes accurate estimates of the radio maps of each BS, and is tailored to work in realistic propagation environments in urban settings. 

See the paper [Real-time Outdoor Localization Using Radio Maps: A Deep Learning Approach](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.12556.pdf) for more information.

The associated dataset *RadioLocSeer* is available at the [project main page](https://radiomapseer.github.io/LocUNet.html).
